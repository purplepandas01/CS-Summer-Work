FAST IMAGE RECOGNITION

Travel and Tourism

Computer vision systems are benefitically in the travel and tourism industry as it makes it easier for airports to control who or what is there and ensure that illegal objects such as weapons are not being brought in. During x-ray scans, these systems can quickly identify the objects and notify employees making the process shorter. Face recognition technology could also be used alongside computer vision systems for automated check-ins at the airport entrance. However, sometimes the system would not be able to recognise and object is the image is unclear or different to the images of the object stored in the database. The risks of these systems is that some people or objects might be missed due to blind spots in the cameras.

Gaming and Entertainment

Virtual reality may use image recognition to identify the whereabout of the person so it produce the view from the specific point of view of the person. It allows for better gameplay as it can track players during sports games which allows the character to perform the same action or position. However, if some movements are too fast or outside of the camera's frame the system will not pick it up which would be a problem for gameplay. The system may store the data collected onto satellile servers without permission which is an invasion of privacy.

Education and Learning

This system can be incredibly useful when learning new things. Young children could identify new objects by taking a picture of it or people could translate languages making it easier to understand when travelling to new countries/places. It would allow people to learn different types of various species/breeds at any time or learn how to do maths questions by scanning the problem. However, if the system does not have valid data for the language or species/breed it would not be able to give correct information. The risks of this include incorrect translations or miss-reading characters causing different outcomes.

Transport and Navigation

To enable self-driving cars, computer vision systems are vital. These systems can use multiple cameras to detect people, objects, road markings and signs in order to safety park or drive without someone controlling the car. It may not be able to identify exactly how far away something is or see objects in the dark as it uses cameras instead of sensors. Some signs or objects may not be identified which could cause accidents or damage to the vehicle.

Medicine and Healthcare

When testing for cancer, image recognition can quickly and easily identify cancerous cells and the quantity making it easier for the doctor to diagnose and start the treatment needed. However, some cells may look different or be in different stages therefore the system may not register it unlike a doctor would be able to visually notice. If cancerous cells are mistaken for different things this could lead to the health issue further developing and causing even more damage.
